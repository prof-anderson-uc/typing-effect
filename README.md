# CSS Typing Effect Demo

This project showcases a pure CSS-based typing animation effect, demonstrating how to create the illusion of text being typed out character by character without the use of JavaScript.

## How It Works

The typing effect is accomplished using CSS animations applied to the `::after` pseudo-element of the text container. The key components include:

- **Content Display:** The text to be "typed" is placed within a `<div>` element.
- **Pseudo-element Animation:** The `::after` pseudo-element is used to create a dynamic cursor that simulates typing.
- **Keyframes Animation:** CSS `@keyframes` are utilized to progressively reveal the text and animate the cursor.

## Files in the Repository

- `index.html` – Contains the HTML structure.
- `style.css` – Holds the CSS code responsible for styling and animations.
